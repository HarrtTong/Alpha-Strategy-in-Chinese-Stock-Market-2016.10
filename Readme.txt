This is an Alpha Strategy for Chinese Stock Market finished in 2016.11 together by Henry Guo and Bruce Zhang.

This code was originally designed to start our own hedge hund. 

This code should be used together with a local database. Our local database is based on data from CSMAR.

The process of the code is:
Get Data at the First Tading Day for Each Month--> Calculate Effective Factor Data --> Alpha Test on Each Factor --> Form Portfolio --> Backtest on the Portfolio --> Return Result 

Generally speaking, we have found five effective factors on Chinese Stock Market.
1. Momentum Factor
2. Idiosyncratic Volatility
3. Revised Turnover Rate based on market value
4. Use PE, PB to get abnormal return from the last group

For future improvement:
1. Find new factors and revise existing factors to capture alpha in a more effective way
2. Ways of Combining effective factors
3. Better way for beta hedging. Way to eliminate basis spread and decrease commission when switch index future contract between months.


We have found more effective factors from the study of professtional papers and research reports from investment banks.
